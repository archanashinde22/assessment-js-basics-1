// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/
// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain






//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added. " 

const analysisOfRequirements = "  In this step we gather, analyse  and validate the information. Define the requirements and prototype for new systemj. Evaluate the alterrnatives and  prioritize the requirements. Examine the information needs of end-user and enhances the system goal.Software reuirement Specification document which include speicfication of software , hardware , functional and network requirement of the system is prepared at the end of step "
const design = " It includes design of application, network , database, user interfaces amd system interfaces. in this phase Design document is created which includes transformation of SRS document into logical structure, which contains detailed anbd complete set of specification. Create training, maintenance and operation plan."
const Implementation = " In this step, developer implement the design into source code through coding. Developer will do Unit testing of code and at last code will be available for testing  "
const testingAndIntegration = "In testing and integration phase , Tester will test the software and find out any bugs or defects that need to be fixed and retested later . Tester will document all the defects , test reports. In integration , code from different modules will be integrated together and  make sure that it operates in accordance with the defined the user requirements. After this phase the product is released to customer in deployment "
const maintain = " Once the software  is launched, the maintainance phase starts. In this step,  the software will require regular updates and maintenance. End User issues are handled in this step.  The maintenance includes handling the residual bugs that the software coders were unable to patch before the launch of the software."
